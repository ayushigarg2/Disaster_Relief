# Disaster Relief

This is program for Earthquake Predictor. 

## Before Running

Firstly, you have to download the data first from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GFGXiG8V3FIc5YKTP-dejyFPH3jAw95i?usp=drive_link)

It is quite large data ~10GB. So, it will take a while. After downloading, you have to move this data file to `Data` folder.

In the meantime, you can install the dependencies to run the program. First of all, you need to install Python 3 as well as pip.

Then, you have to run

```
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib 
```

And also, you have to install `tensorflow`


Now, make sure that the `train.csv` is present in `Data` folder and all the dependencies are installed.

## Running the model

To run, you have to open the terminal in the repository folder, and run the `main.py` file, using

```
python3 main.py
```
